# Feature Introduction

The home page can search for player information, just like below:

![Search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LightningSw/TeamInsightZ/info/search.png "Search Results")

Here, due to the server problem of the region I play in, the record list is not correctly displayed. Normally, the record list will appear below the player information.

![Champion Selection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LightningSw/TeamInsightZ/info/champselect.png "Champion Selection Interface")

You can switch the record and player information through the switch below.

### <span style="color:yellow;">Note</span> In Tencent (Chinese server), the season usage count is invalid.
